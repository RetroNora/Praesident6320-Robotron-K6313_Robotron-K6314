Praesident 6320 aka VEB Robotron Soemmerda 6313, a 9-pin dot matrix printer. Sold to western countries as 'Praesident'. This series can use different interface modules - it was exported with Commodore serial bus module.

Robotron K6314 is a bigger version of K6313, with up to B3 paper size printing. I got it with IFSS module.
